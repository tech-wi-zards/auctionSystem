This project is an online auction initiative that hosts online auctions for a variety of products on a 
website and provides services to both sellers and buyers. Users can set up auctions for their 
products, and buyers can register and bid on the various products or goods offered for bidding.

Secure Online Auction System Project consists of the following parts:

  _Home:_ This is the welcome page which contains directions for the other options.
 
  _Sign up:_ This is used to create new account, either a buyer account or seller account.

  _Seller Login:_ After logging into their account, the seller can upload the product which they are willing to sell along with the minimum bidding price.

  _Buyer Login:_ After logging into their account, the buyer can view a list of products that are up for auction and place a bid on one of them.

  _Admin Login:_ This is only for administrator for maintains.
  
## Advantages:
There are no noisy crowds like in a Traditional Auction system where buyers and sellers must sit and bid, and there is no general vexing that occurs when bidding in a Traditional Auction system.

There are no time constraints, so bidders can bid at any time and from any location.

The bidding procedure can be carried out on a worldwide scale.

## Disadvantages:
The product or goods can't be seen in person by the user
